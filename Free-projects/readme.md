First I made the pil create new image, i played with it changing the width and height and also changing the colors. 
After that, I added some text on it and changed the color. I tried to make the image blur but I failed with the code 
I found online. 
I saved a new image in my free projects folder, I had some issues uploadig it but it was just a syntax error and at the 
end I could upload it. I rotated and I also made the image blur, the radius helped me to make the image more blur.
