# # In-Class Exercise: Exploring Gutenberg Using Python
#  This exercise includes
#  both collaborative and independent components. You will be working primarily in your own Jupyter notebook, but will be collaborating on investigating a question of your own choosing.
#%% [markdown]
# 
#  First, you will need to install some dependencies:
# 
#  
#  - Install BSD-DB according to the instructions here:
#  https://github.com/c-w/Gutenberg
# 
#  - Next, we'll install a library for downloading texts from gutenberg via pip. After selecting the appropriate shell for Anaconda, type the following into the terminal:
#  
#  ```bash
#  pip install gutenberg
#  ```
#  
#  - Finally, install TextBlob and necessary corpora:
#  ```na;j
#  pip install -U textblob
#  python -m textblob.download_corpora
#  ```

#%%
# Let's begin by downloading and using the version of Moby Dick published on Project Gutenberg.
from gutenberg.acquire import load_etext
from gutenberg.cleanup import strip_headers
from textblob import TextBlob

text = strip_headers(load_etext(2701)).strip()
blob = TextBlob(text)
# print(text)  # prints 'MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE\n\nBy Herman Melville ...'
# This will save the text to a local .txt file in this directory.
source = open('in-class/week-6/mobydick.txt','w',encoding="utf-16",newline='\n')
source.write(text)
source.close()


#%%
type(text)


#%%
blob.noun_phrases   # WordList(['titular threat', 'blob',
                    #            'ultimate movie monster',
                    #            'amoeba-like mass', ...])


#%%
for sentence in blob.sentences:
    print(sentence.sentiment.polarity)


#%%
from operator import itemgetter  

d = blob.word_counts
for key, value in sorted(d.items(), key = itemgetter(1), reverse = True):
    print(key, value)


#%%
max = 0
index = 0
# Find the longest sentence in the work
for key, sentence in enumerate(blob.sentences):
    if(len(sentence.words) > max):
        max = len(sentence.words)
        index = key


#%%
# Find the longest word in the work
max = 0
for key, word in enumerate(blob.words):
    if(len(word) > max):
        max = len(word)
        index = key
print(max)
print(blob.words[index])

#%% [markdown]
# # Parts of Speech
# 
# Another method Montfort described is to use the tags to count certain parts of speech. Below is an example that uses a single sentence, but the same could be applied to a full manuscript.

#%%

pride = TextBlob('''It is a truth universally acknowledged, 
that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in 
want of a wife.''')


#%%
def adjs(pride):
    count = 0
    for (word, tag) in pride.tags:
        if tag == 'JJ':
            count = count + 1
    return count


#%%
adjs(pride)

# # Creating Figures
# There are many ways to create figures. Below is one example of a table. You can save the figure to a file. 
# 
# You will need to install orca, however, using conda in order to create a static image:
# ```
# conda install -c plotly plotly-orca
# ```

#%%
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Table(header=dict(values=['A Scores', 'B Scores']),
                 cells=dict(values=[[100, 90, 80, 90], [95, 85, 75, 95]]))
                     ])
fig.show()
fig.write_image("in-class/week-6/fig1.png")


#%%

                 cells=dict(values=[[100, 90, 80, 90], [95, 85, 75, 95]]))
                     ])
fig.show()
fig.write_image("in-class/week-6/fig1.png")

#%% [markdown]
# We will work with other types of figures, graphs, and tables in Lab 2.
# 
# To turn in the assignment, follow the instructions in class_notes.ipynb
