This could be a dataset, or it could be images or other files you want to process.\n\nThere are four main ways to acquire and store data (values):\n\n1. Directly through a *networking protocol*. This means locating a remote computer and sending a request that identifies the information needed, using HTTP or another method.\n2. Using a program called a *database*, which may be on the same computer. The database handles persisting, sorting, and organizing the data.\n3. You can directly access and store information as files on the operating system. These can either be *text* or *binary* files. \n4. Through a special-purpose library that encapsulates the lower-level network access to a data source. This includes online content sources such as project Gutenberg, Twitter, OpenWeather, or others. \n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# Directly downloading web resources\n\nYou can load files that are publicly available on the internet using the `urllib` package and the `request` module:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import urllib.request\npage = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt')\n# The return value of page.read() is bytes, which could be an image, or it could be text. \ntext = page.read().decode('utf-8')\nprint(text[716:1000])\n\n# utf-8 is an encoding that maps bytes to specific characters for rendering.

What does this tell you about the work?\n - Break the work down into smaller segments (Chapters) and compare the frequency of character names or terms in each. \n - Find the top used words \n - Find out the average sentiment of the work, including the most positive and most negative sentences. Do these correlate to parts of the story? \n\nUse this information to form a hypotheses about the two works based on exploring the work using natural language processing. You can use works you are familiar with, or you could compare Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813) to Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851). You could also compare two works by the same author -- the choice is yours.\n\nI recommend keeping a copy of the work in the same directory.\n\nPlease turn in a url to a Google doc in WebCourses with the following:\n  - Location of the code in your repository\n  - What questions you decided to pursue\n  - What information you decided to collect and compare\n  - Results, if any, from running your scripts against the two books\n  - Any conclusions or future work that this exercise would lead to, given additional experience with Python."}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
